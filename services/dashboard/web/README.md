## Getting Started

Edit .zshrc and add at the bottom

```bash
alias rw="doppler run -- yarn rw"
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
# Run doppler setup to pick your env settings to be auto injected at runtime!
yarn doppler setup

# once you have set up the zshrc configyou can shorten any RedWood command to rw
rw dev
```

that should start a sever on [http://localhost:8910](http://localhost:8910) allowing you to send see the dashboaed.
